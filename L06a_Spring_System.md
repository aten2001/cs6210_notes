L06a Spring System
===================




Unorganized notes
------------------

Spring came out as Sun Solaris' MC product. See [Khalidi's paper](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/sd96/full_papers/khalidi.ps)

Issue that Spring saw: Innovate using brand new OS or better implementation of a known OS.

hardware vendors dont change things that often, so software follows suit. Seems like this is a big thing.

**Thu Mar 13 02:20:59 2014** : 

- Started watching the videos today at about 10 PM CST. 
- Switched to the "Overview of Spring" pdf, but couldnt understand the why behind such a system.
- So searched on the net for Spring MC and came across the Khalidi paper (see below) which explained the commercial reasons better as well as the subsystems that were actually built. This paper also explained how doors actually work.
- Also found the [wikipedia page on Spring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_(operating_system)) useful in explaining how it is similar to Mach as well as the business rationale.
- Then started reading the Hamilton paper to understand how Subcontracts work.
