- Videos:
	Watching 1h 56 m = 116 mins = 17 mins/day for 7 days
		ie 	watch @ 2x speed
			go back and write notes for same time.
- Papers: 4

	writing comprehension of paper: 1 hr
- Quizzes: 2 x 5 mins  = 15 min
- Research online and piazza: ? hrs
Total estimate = 1h 17m for 4 d, then 17 min
              or 6h total
